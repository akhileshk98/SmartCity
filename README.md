# Networked Traffic Control in Smart City
With the rapid urbanization and increasing vehicular traffic in modern cities, efficient traffic management has become a critical necessity. This paper proposes a networked traffic control framework designed specifically for autonomous cars operating in a smart city context. Through collaborative traffic management strategies, such as dynamic routing, pedestrian crossing, and accident scenario, the proposed framework aims to enhance traffic efficiency, safety, and sustainability. The report details the system architecture, communication protocols, control algorithms, and experimental results obtained from simulations.

## Implementation
1. Wokwi Simulator is used with FreeRTOS Framework

## Modelling
Enterprise Architect tool is used for System Modelling.
